Fortran: dynamic allocation, matrix size defined at input
mm.0.F90		-> main (with only parallel clause)
mm.1.F90		-> main (with parallel independent clause)
mm.2.F90		-> main (with parallel independent clause+unrolling)
mod_tools.F90		-> auxiliary

C: static allocation, matrix size defined in the code. Default value = 4096
mm.c			-> main (with Kernel clause)
inc_precision.h 	-> auxiliary
